# If an option is not provided in the file, its default value will
# be used.

# `ssid` is the network name that will be detected.
# Its length should be between 1 and 32 characters.
#
# Default value is ssid=Rpi Access Point
ssid=TOTEM6

# `passphrase` is the password required to connect to the network.
# Its length should be between 8 and 63 characters (WPA-PSK).
#
# Default value is passphrase=rpi_ap_pass
passphrase=password

# hostname will be appendded to the SSID by default. The `hide_hostname` option
# is used to prevent this behavior. This is convenient to differenciate hosts
# configured with the same SSID.
#
# Default value is not specified, hostname will be appendded.
# To disable this behavior, `hide_hostname=1`. Any other value will be ignored.
hide_hostname=1
