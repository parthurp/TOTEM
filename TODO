#### urgent
TEST ON THE RPI AND THEN GOOOO ONLINE

#### to fix
- sometimes several vibrations felt for only one note: detection is not working properly? texture too random?
- tremors not adapted to long notes... add a threshold? (adapt high threshold?)
- add a noise gate very much upstream of the work flow

#### ideas for future versions
- change the way the oo_preseti messages are generated, instead of adding it manually, consider generating it automatically
